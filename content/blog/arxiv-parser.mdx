# A Chrome Extension for the Tab-Hoarding Academic

If your browser tabs look like the bibliography section of a survey paper, you're probably a PhD student. After the nth time of playing "find that one methodology section in the sea of PDFs," I decided to solve this peculiarly academic problem. Enter the Academic Paper Tab Renamer: a Chrome extension that transforms your cryptic tab wasteland into a properly labeled research library.

## The Before/After

Current state of affairs:
```
PDF | PDF | PDF | arxiv.org/abs/2402.1... | openreview.net/pdf?id=...
```

What you actually want to see:
```
Attention Is All You Need | BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers | An Image is Worth 16x16 Words
```

The extension does exactly what it says on the tin - renames your tabs to show actual paper titles. Because let's face it, pattern matching arxiv IDs isn't the kind of pattern recognition we should be spending our PhD on.

## Core Features

1. **Title Extraction**: Automatically pulls paper titles from:
   - arXiv
   - OpenReview
   - IEEE Xplore
   - ACM Digital Library
   - Semantic Scholar
   - SpringerLink
   - ScienceDirect

2. **Research-Oriented Design**:
   - Handles batch paper opening (for those "this looks relevant" sprees)
   - Local caching (because you'll definitely revisit that paper you skimmed)
   - Works with both repository pages and direct PDFs
   - Clean interface that stays out of your way

## Roadmap

Future features (when not writing my thesis):
- Support for more academic platforms
- Quick-search across open papers
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Paper grouping by topic/conference
- Citation export

## Installation

For the early adopters:
1. Clone the [repository](https://github.com/joanvelja/arxiv_extension)
2. `npm install && npm run build`
3. Load in Chrome extensions page: `chrome://extensions/`
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `dist` folder generated by the build step
5. Enjoy!

Chrome Web Store version coming after peer review (just kidding, soon).

Consider this my contribution to reducing the cognitive load of academic paper management. Star the repo if it saves you from tab-induced chaos, and feel free to contribute - pull requests are the best form of peer review.

*P.S. Yes, it's open source (MIT licensed). No, it won't write your related work section for you. Yet.*
